## Password Complexity Checker

This is a simple Password Complexity Checker tool built using Python's Tkinter library. It evaluates the strength of a password based on various factors such as length, uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and special characters. The application provides real-time feedback on the password's strength and suggests improvements.

- **Password Analysis**: The application checks the entered password for the following criteria:
  - Length
  - Uppercase letters
  - Lowercase letters
  - Digits
  - Special characters (e.g., @, #, $, etc.)
- **Strength Feedback**: Based on the password evaluation, the application provides feedback and suggests improvements.
  - Weak Password
  - Medium Strength Password
  - Strong Password
